In the beginning of the 2018 year, I declared [my New Year Resolutions](http://www.jameszhang.io/articles/2018-01-01-new-years-resolution)
and listed nine measurable goals that I aim to accomplish by the end of this year:

> 1. 400 miles of running
> 1. Complete 3 side projects
> 1. 1 Visual Design Course
> 1. 1 Sales/Communication Course
> 1. Meet 5 new friends
> 1. Learn 10 new cooking recipes
> 1. Read 8 books comprehensively read from beginning to end
> 1. Complete 10 artworks
> 1. Create 1 patent

## The Next Steps

Now that the overarching goals are established, my game plan is pretty straightforward:

1. First, I need to measure how much time each goal is going to take me.
2. Then, I will set milestone goals for each month, starting with January.
3. Finally, at the end of each month, I will assess my progress, make adjustments if I need to, and plan the next month's milestones.

## Measuring my goals

To better understand the implications of these goals, I will break them
down by year, month, and day:

| Goal | Amount in a year | Amount by month | Amount by day |
| ------------- |:-------------: |:-------------:|:-----:|
| Running | **400 miles** | ~33.3 miles per month | ~1.1 miles per day |
| Side Projects | **3** | 1 every 4 months | - |
| Visual Design Course | **1** | 2 months | 2 hours per day during the course |
| Sales/Communication Course | **1** | ?? | ?? |
| Meet New friends | **5** | 1 every 2.5 months | 1 every 75 days |
| Cooking | **10** | 1 every 1.2 months | ~3 hours per recipe |
| Books | **8** | 1 every 1.5 month | 1 every 45 days |
| Artworks | **10** | 1 every 1.2 months | ~2 days per artwork (depends on medium) |
| Patents | **1** | ?? | ?? |

## Impressions so far

* **5 new friends seems too easy.**  I feel I could already accomplish this if I go to just 3 meetups or events.
* **1.1 miles a day and 10 recipes seem like good baselines.**  It's not really challenging, but good enough to keep a good habit.
* **Courses are time consuming.**  The Visual Design Course itself is 2 hour classes every Tuesday and Thursday for 2 months and in between classes will have homework assignments and projects.  When I'm doing a course, I probably won't have too much time to work on any major things like side projects or artworks.  I may think about scoping down the Sales/Communication Course if the commitment is also large.
* **8 books and 10 artworks seem fair given all the other activities.**
* **3 Side Projects in one year will always be doable.** The scope of any side project can be small or large and scaled by how much time I have.  So even if I only had 1 month left in the year, I might still pull off all 3, though they would be more aggressive hackathon-like projects.
* **1 Patent is uncertain.**  I don't think it takes too much of my time but the process may be time consuming.  I just need more familiarity with how patents work at IBM first.
* **Some goals may complement each other.**  For example, if I go to a running meetup, I could meet new people _and_ run my miles at once.  Some projects in my Visual Design course could count towards Artworks or Side Projects.

## Closing thoughts

Individually, none of my goals are difficult.  The challenge will be how
effectively I can manage my time.  I feel my goals are reasonably challenging overall and
do not detract from their original intentions.  To re-emphasize, the purpose of my 2018 goals is not to
overwhelm myself, but to push my baselines.

Now that I have measured my goals I can start planning for the first milestone.
