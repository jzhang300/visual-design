2017 was a tremendous year of personal growth for me.  Some major accomplishments were **completing a half marathon for the first time**, **receiving a promotion and leading a development team**, and **launching my new personal site**.  Overall, I learned how to really enjoy myself more and become a more emotionally resilient person.

## This year's goals

This year I will challenge myself further with these goals:

1. 400 miles of running
1. Complete 3 side projects
1. 1 Visual Design Course
1. 1 Sales/Communication Course
1. Meet 5 new friends
1. Learn 10 new cooking recipes
1. Read 8 books comprehensively read from beginning to end
1. Complete 10 artworks
1. Create 1 patent

## What’s unique about these goals?
Some examples of goals that do not work are "exercising more," "reading more books," or "learning a new language."   Goals like these usually don’t stick around because…
* they’re too vague.
* they’re not measurable.
* they have no gameplan or end goal in sight.
* they’re unrealistic.
* there’s no time frame.

Goals that _have_ successfully worked for me is when I [trained for the half marathon](http://www.jameszhang.io/articles/2017-03-09-my-first-half-marathon) last year.  Taking what I have learned, I have designed my 2018 New Year Resolution goals to…
* have clearly defined commitments.
* have an end goal and steps to get there.
* be realistic.
* be measurable.

These goals are actually not unique.  They’re based on [SMART goals](http://topachievement.com/smart.html).

## Closing thoughts
Having clear goals creates more accountability and provides structure that helps me become a more well-rounded individual.  Goals will be tweaked as needed if too unrealistic or too easy.
