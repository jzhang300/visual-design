I've had many people tell me that I'm an easy person to work with and that I'm pretty easy to talk to.
For me, this is something I take pride in, because sometimes the enjoyment of
work is not the work itself but the people that I work with.  I believe in trying to
bring the best out of anyone and emphasize any positive thing I see.

This focus on seeking complementation with people and emphasis on the positives may partly just be my innate personality,
but over the course of my career, I've evolved it to become a conscious strategy when working with others.
In _"The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution,"_ Walter Isaacson makes a point that the great innovations of mankind did not happen by lone innovators in some basement, but by collaborations of people whose talents complemented each other.

In this post, I want to share some tips of wisdom I've learned that can help
you become the person that everyone wants to work with.

## Finding a Common Language

As a front-end web developer, I get to work with plenty of designers as well as backend
and full-stack developers.  Because of my exposure to these worlds, I can relate and share
the same passions as both archetypes.  By sharing common interests and finding different
ways to connect with the people I work with, I'm able to find a common language.

The common language may be an end result, but it is not the focus point.  You
should not be thinking, "I'm meeting a new person, I need to find a common language!"

No, instead here are some points of focus:

1. **Be genuinely interested in the other person, and try to learn something new.**
1. **Try to understand the other person's challenges, joys, and working styles.**
1. **Look for opportunities for positivity.**

The first two are pretty self-explanatory. I want to talk more about the third point though.
The thing is, there's an opportunity cost to the time and energy spent complaining about
the negatives and the problems. By finding positive things and dwelling on the positives instead,
moving towards productive outcomes becomes easier, while also losing out on unproductive
negativity. Who wouldn't want to work with someone who makes them feel respected and good?

One trap with positivity is "forced" positivity. Forced positivity feels like you're trying too hard
while not being genuine.  The key to avoiding this is to be loose and not goal-oriented.
This may take practice and patience but is totally achievable.

## How to Handle Conflicts

Inevitably, there will be conflicts, differing opinions, and toes stepping on toes.
The way conflicts are handled can either be detrimental and time-wasting, or they can
be efficient and productive.

Here's a quick list of do's and don't's:

| Don'ts | Do's|
|:------|-----|
| Do not attack people | Attack problems |
| Do not attack people's works | Find areas worth praise and respect |
| Do not pass the blame potato lightly | Pass the credit potato |

It is sort of common sense that no one wants to hear that they suck, or that the work
they did sucks, or that it was their fault.  And yet these are so easy to do because
deep in your heart you know it's true.

To remedy the "don't's," the tricks in the "do's" can be surprisingly effective.

When you attack a person, you're
fighting against each other.  When you're attacking problems, without offending people,
the other person is no longer fighting against you but *alongside* you towards a common problem.

When you attack a person's work, you may be spitting on their hard work and efforts.
To offer more constructive criticism, I like to first be genuine and give praise
to the areas I think are good (i.e. "I really like this part.  I think it really addresses that problem.").  Then I follow up with something like "why don't we do this,
or why isn't it like this?"  Then this opens up a discussion where you get to better understand the context of the work, and
the person is more willing to listen to the feedback you have.
Coming out of this, you and/or the other person will likely walk away learning something new.
The challenge with this is that having a strong, pre-conceived opinion can hinder listening.
Having an opinion without the listening component will result in you just pushing your
ideas onto people.

In the third "don't," I say don't pass the blame potato *lightly*. I've seen, firsthand, when people
pass the blame potato like an auto-defense mechanism, and it is one of the most destructive things
for a team.  Sometimes it's necessary to pass blame objectively, but it shouldn't be
something to be abused.  What has worked for me is when people give others credit for their good work,
and focuses on the objective problem rationally.

## Conclusion

Positivity can be felt as weak and passive and not being true or "real," but I think it has
underrated impacts and is challenging to maintain. People sometimes forget that it's not
about who is right or wrong but about how we can strive toward positive outcomes.
To have an ego and to be real about your opinions and feelings doesn't mean to
sacrifice good teamwork.
