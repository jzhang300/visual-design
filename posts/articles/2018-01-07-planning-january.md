In my previous post about [breaking down my goals](http://www.jameszhang.io/articles/2018-01-06-breaking-down-goals), I measured how much time each goal is going to take.

## Planning

This month, I set out to accomplish the following by order of priority:

| Goal | Amount in January | Total Amount this year |
| ------------- | :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Running | **93 miles** | 400 miles |
| Visual Design Course | **3 weeks** | 8 week course |
| Cooking | **1 recipe** | 10 recipes |
| Meet New friends | **1 friend** | 5 friends |
| Books | **[Dave Ramsey's Complete Guide to Money](https://www.daveramsey.com/store/books/dave-s-bestsellers/dave-ramseys-complete-guide-to-money/prodcgtm.html)** | 8 |
| Side Projects | 0 | 3 |
| Sales/Communication Course | 0 | 1 |
| Artworks | 0 | 10 |
| Patents | 0 | 1 |

## My Thought Process

Running and Visual Design Course are at the top because their schedules are fixed.  The 93 miles
come from my predefined training schedule I'm doing for the [Austin Half Marathon](https://youraustinmarathon.com/).
And my Visual Design course starts next week onwards, which I anticipate will take a lot of my weekday evenings.

My weekdays currently look like this:
* running will take up my mornings
* day job will take up the day
* Visual Design Course will take up most of my evenings

I figure I can use one weekend to learn a recipe, leaving the remaining two weekends for flexibility
such as meeting new people, hanging out with other friends, or knocking out another
goal item.

Lastly, the current book I'm starting is 325 pages, which averages about 13 pages a
day.  I think it's best to do this as soon as I wake up before I go running.
