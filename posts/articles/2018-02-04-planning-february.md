In my [previous post](http://www.jameszhang.io/articles/2018-01-07-planning-january), I set myself
milestone goals for numerous activities. Below is the detailed summary of my progress.

## Detailed Summary of January

| Goal                                                                                                                                                      |                Amount completed                | Amount planned January | Total Amount this year |

| Meet New friends                                                                                                                                          |     <b class="text--green-2">4 friends</b>     |        1 friend        |       5 friends        |

While I didn't completely meet all my milestone goals, I still think did quite a lot in a single month.
When I planned my goals, I didn't do a good enough job setting aside "rainy day" budget.
Some external factors that made it difficult to achieve milestones were bad weather, sick days, and other tasks.

## Adjustments

_Meet New Friends_ will become _Attend Social Events_ once per month.

## Closing Thoughts

By cutting down on some milestones, I give myself more flexibility and focus so that I do not spread myself too thin and become scatter-brained.
Doing this is also good for practicing my estimation skills, which is something I'm traditionally terrible at.
