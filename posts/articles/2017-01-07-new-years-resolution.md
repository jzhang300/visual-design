Hello, World!

It is fitting that my first blog post to commemorate the birth of this site is also about my 2017 New Year's resolution.  My new site along with the new year represents a new beginning for me in my life.

2016 was a year of growing pains and a year of constant negativity. Like with all things though, it has come and past, and I've come back, learning a few things that will help me move forward.

Among the things, I've come to realize the importance of family, friends, and other positive influences, who are there for you when you're low, and likewise how important it is to be there for others as well.  No one can do things alone, everyone needs the help and support from others.

So moving forward to 2017, I have two new years resolutions:

1. Create more
2. Run more

## Create More

**I am my best version of myself when I create things I'm passionate about.**

The first major project I will create is this website.  Through this site, I can post my works on a regular basis, and develop a voice to share my ideas and expertise to the world.

**At work**, one of my goals this year is to make our [Watson React Component Library](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/react-components/) into an industry leading example of great react ui components. **On the side**, I want to create more web apps and art.

## Run More

This year, my coworker challenged me to run a half-marathon and convinced me to sign up for the [NYCRUNS Central Park Half Marathon](https://nycruns.com/races/?race=nycruns-central-park-half-marathon) for February 26, 2017.  I've never run a marathon before, and I've never been able to run more than two miles.  To finish a half-marathon will be a great personal accomplishment.

The best part about this challenge is that I'm not doing it alone.  One of my other friends is doing the [One Punch Man Training](http://roamstrong.com/one-punch-man-workout/), and we're both trying to motivate each other with our respective challenges.

## Final Words

I believe that by creating more and running more, good things will follow, and I'll be the best that I can be and positively influence those around me.
